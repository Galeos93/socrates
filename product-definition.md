### **Definitions**

* **Claim** – A statement in the text that can be **directly or indirectly verified** using the text itself. It expresses knowledge, facts, or rules the author intends to communicate.
  **Example:** “Words stressed on the final syllable ending in *n* or *s* carry a written accent.”

  * Can be tested by recognition or reasoning over the text
  * Does **not** require external knowledge or real-world skill execution

* **Skill** – The ability to **apply knowledge or rules** in a practical or external context beyond what is explicitly stated in the text.
  **Example:** “Given the word *corazón*, add the correct accent mark.”

  * Requires producing a correct answer according to external standards
  * Goes beyond comprehension and reasoning about the text

* **Question** –  Sentence (or prompt) that seeks an answer **related to the document**. It can target either:

1. **Claim comprehension**

   * The answer is **grounded in a claim in the document**.
   * Tests understanding, reasoning, or inference over the text.
   * **Example:**

     * Text claim: “Words stressed on the final syllable ending in *n* or *s* carry a written accent.”
     * Question: “According to the text, which words require an accent?”
   * Correctness is **verifiable using the document**.

2. **Skill application**

   * The answer requires **applying knowledge from the document** to a new or practical situation.
   * Tests procedural ability, transfer, or real-world application.
   * **Example:**

     * Text claim: “Words stressed on the final syllable ending in *n* or *s* carry a written accent.”
     * Question: “Add the correct accent to the word *corazón*.”
   * Correctness depends on **external standards or rules**, not just the document.
